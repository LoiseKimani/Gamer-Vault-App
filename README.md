# Project Template: React/Rails API

## Description

This app allows you to search, post and view reviews of your favorite
        games. Whether you're a casual gamer or a hardcore enthusiast, you'll
        find plenty of helpful information and insights here.

**Note**: if you are not planning to deploy your app to Render and prefer to use
SQLite, you will need to make the following changes in the project files:

1. In the `Gemfile`, replace `gem 'pg', '~> 1.1'` with `gem 'sqlite3', '~>
   1.4'`.
2. In the `database.yml` file, change the line `adapter: postgresql` to
   `adapter: sqlite3`.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Render account
- Postgresql

See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.

## Setup

Start by **cloning** (not forking) the project template repository and removing
the remote:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:learn-co-curriculum/project-template-react-rails-api.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ git remote rm origin
```

Then, [create a new remote repository][create repo] on GitHub. Head to
[github.com](https://github.com) and click the **+** icon in the top-right
corner and follow the steps to create a new repository. **Important**: don't
check any of the options such as 'Add a README file', 'Add a .gitignore file',
etc. — since you're importing an existing repository, creating any of those
files on GitHub will cause issues.

If you're working with a partner,
[add them as a collaborator][add collaborator] on GitHub. From your repo on
GitHub, go to Settings > Manage Access > Invite a collaborator and enter your
partner's username. Once your partner has access, they should git **clone** (not
fork) the repository.

[add collaborator]: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository

Finally, connect the GitHub remote repository to your local repository and push
up your code:

```console
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-project-name.git
$ git push -u origin main
```

When you're ready to start building your project, run:

```sh
bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client
```

You can use the following commands to run the application:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
